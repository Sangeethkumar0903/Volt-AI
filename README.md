# EV Battery Heat Checking using Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning techniques to monitor and predict the temperature of electric vehicle (EV) batteries in real-time. It leverages various sensors, machine learning models, and data processing techniques to detect heat anomalies, ensuring battery safety and longevity.

## Project Overview

Electric vehicle batteries are crucial components, and their temperature must be monitored to ensure optimal performance and prevent overheating. This project focuses on predicting battery heat using deep learning models trained on real-time temperature and sensor data from EV batteries.

The deep learning models can be integrated with EV management systems to alert users of potential overheating risks, ensuring better safety, performance, and battery health.

## Features

- Real-time battery temperature monitoring.
- Deep learning model to predict future battery temperature.
- Alert system when abnormal heat patterns are detected.
- Data visualization for temperature analysis over time.
- Integration with EV diagnostic systems for real-time feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for building and training models.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data handling and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Visualization of battery heat data.
- **OpenCV**: Optional (if using image-based sensors or visual monitoring).
- **Flask/Django**: Web framework for real-time data visualization and alerts (if applicable).

## Requirements

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (>=2.x)
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (if applicable)
- Flask/Django (for web integration, if applicable)

## You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ev-battery-heat-checking.git
cd ev-battery-heat-checking
```
## Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```
Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
- Data Acquisition: Collect temperature data from the EV battery sensors. This data will be used for training the model and real-time predictions.

- Training the Model:

- Use the training dataset to train the deep learning model.
Example:
```bash
python train_model.py
```
This will output a trained model file (battery_temp_model.h5) that can be used for predictions.

## Real-time Prediction:

To make real-time predictions, use the following command:
```bash
python predict_temperature.py
```
## Web Interface (optional):

- If using Flask/Django, run the server to see real-time battery heat data and alerts.
```bash
python app.py
```
The web interface will show live temperature data and any alerts triggered by the model.

## Deep Learning Model Architecture
The deep learning model used for battery temperature prediction is based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), particularly LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, ideal for time-series prediction tasks.

## Model Overview:
Input: Time-series temperature data from EV battery sensors.
Model: LSTM network with 2 hidden layers.
Output: Predicted future battery temperature.

```bash
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])))
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=False))
model.add(Dense(units=1))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
```
## Model Training:
Training the model involves using historical temperature data. The dataset should include temperature readings along with timestamps to ensure accurate time-series forecasting.

```bash
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
model.save('battery_temp_model.h5')
Example Data
Example data files (CSV format) with sensor readings can be found in the data/ folder. The data should have columns like:

timestamp: Time of the reading.
temperature: Battery temperature.
sensor_id: Identifier for the sensor (if multiple sensors are used).
```
## Model Evaluation
You can evaluate the performance of the trained model using the following code:

python
```bash
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae}')
```
